//Normal Objects:
let duck = {
    name: "Aflac",
    numLegs: 2,
    sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + this.name + ".";}
  };
  console.log(duck.sayName());
  
  
// Constructor Functions
// Define a Constructor Function
// Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.

// Here is an example of a constructor:

function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}
// This constructor defines a Bird object with properties name, color, and numLegs set to Albert, blue, and 2, respectively. Constructors follow a few conventions:

// Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.
// Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.
// Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.
// Create a constructor, Dog, with properties name, color, and numLegs that are set to a string, a string, and a number, respectively.

function Dog(){
    this.name = 'suzzy';
    this.color = 'white';
    this.numLegs = 4;
}



// Use the Dog constructor from the last lesson to create a new instance of Dog, assigning it to a variable hound.

let hound = new Dog;
console.log(hound);


//Extend Constructors to Receive Arguments
// The Bird and Dog constructors from the last challenge worked well. However, notice that all Birds that are created with the Bird constructor are automatically named Albert, are blue in color, and have two legs. What if you want birds with different values for name and color? It's possible to change the properties of each bird manually but that would be a lot of work:

let swan = new Bird();
swan.name = "Carlos";
swan.color = "white";
// Suppose you were writing a program to keep track of hundreds or even thousands of different birds in an aviary. It would take a lot of time to create all the birds, then change the properties to different values for every one. To more easily create different Bird objects, you can design your Bird constructor to accept parameters:

function Bird(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}
// Then pass in the values as arguments to define each unique bird into the Bird constructor: let cardinal = new Bird("Bruce", "red"); This gives a new instance of Bird with name and color properties set to Bruce and red, respectively. The numLegs property is still set to 2. The cardinal has these properties:

cardinal.name
cardinal.color
cardinal.numLegs
// The constructor is more flexible. It's now possible to define the properties for each Bird at the time it is created, which is one way that JavaScript constructors are so useful. They group objects together based on shared characteristics and behavior and define a blueprint that automates their creation.

// Create another Dog constructor. This time, set it up to take the parameters name and color, and have the property numLegs fixed at 4. Then create a new Dog saved in a variable terrier. Pass it two strings as arguments for the name and color properties.

function Dog(name, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.numLegs = 4;
  }
  
  let terrier = new Dog('suzzy', 'brown')



  //Verify an Object's Constructor with instanceof
// Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the instanceof operator. instanceof allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. Here's an example:

let Bird = function(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let crow = new Bird("Alexis", "black");

crow instanceof Bird;
// This instanceof method would return true. If crow was not an instance of Bird, it wpuld return false.

// If an object is created without using a constructor, instanceof will verify that it is not an instance of that constructor:

// Create a new instance of the House constructor, calling it myHouse and passing a number of bedrooms. Then, use instanceof to verify that it is an instance of House.

function House(numBedrooms) {
  this.numBedrooms = numBedrooms;
}

// Only change code below this line
let myHouse = new House;
myHouse.numBedrooms = 5;

myHouse instanceof House;



//Understand Own Properties
// In the following example, the Bird constructor defines two properties: name and numLegs:

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
// name and numLegs are called own properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that duck and canary each has its own separate copy of these properties. In fact every instance of Bird will have its own copy of these properties. The following code adds all of the own properties of duck to the array ownProps:

let ownProps = [];

for (let property in duck) {
  if(duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps);
// The console would display the value ["name", "numLegs"].

// Add the own properties of canary to the array ownProps.
//answer

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
let ownProps = [];
// Only change code below this line
for(let property in canary){
  if(canary.hasOwnProperty(property)){
    ownProps.push(property)
  }
}
