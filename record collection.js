// You are given an object literal representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has a unique id number as its key and several other properties. Not all albums have complete information.

// You start with an updateRecords function that takes an object literal, records, containing the musical album collection, an id, a prop (like artist or tracks), and a value. Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

// Your function must always return the entire record collection object.
// If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, update or set that album's prop to value.
// If prop is tracks but the album doesn't have a tracks property, create an empty array and add value to it.
// If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, add value to the end of the album's existing tracks array.
// If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.

  //MY ATTEMPT
  function updateRecords(records, id, prop, value) {
    return records;
    if(prop != tracks && value != ''){
      records.id.prop == value
    }else if(prop == tracks && !record.hasOwnProperty(tracks)){
      record.tracks = [1, 2,]
    }else if (prop == track && value != ''){
      record.tracks.push[3]
    }else if(value == ''){
      delete record.prop
    }
      return records;
  }

  //THE CORRECT ANSWER
  function updateRecords(records, id, prop, value) {
    if (value === '') {
      delete records[id][prop];
    } else if (prop === 'tracks') {
      records[id][prop] = records[id][prop] || []; // this is called shortcircuit evaluation, see below for explanation
      records[id][prop].push(value);
    } else {
      records[id][prop] = value;
    }
    return records;
  }

  //First checks if value is a blank string. If so, then the key (prop) is removed from the object.
// If that first check doesnâ€™t pass, it next checks if prop is equal to tracks. The tracks array is initialized if it does not exist, and then value is pushed into the tracks array. (This step uses shortcircuit evaluation)
// If both these checks fail (meaning value is not an empty string and prop is not tracks), then either a new key (prop) and value (value) are added to the object, or an existing key is updated if the prop already exists.
