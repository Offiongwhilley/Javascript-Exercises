//Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()
// An array's length, like the data types it can contain, is not fixed. Arrays can be defined with a length of any number of elements, and elements can be added or removed over time; in other words, arrays are mutable. In this challenge, we will look at two methods with which we can programmatically modify an array: Array.push() and Array.unshift().

// Both methods take one or more elements as parameters and add those elements to the array the method is being called on; the push() method adds elements to the end of an array, and unshift() adds elements to the beginning. Consider the following:

let twentyThree = 'XXIII';
let romanNumerals = ['XXI', 'XXII'];

romanNumerals.unshift('XIX', 'XX');
// romanNumerals would have the value ['XIX', 'XX', 'XXI', 'XXII'].

romanNumerals.push(twentyThree);
// romanNumerals would have the value ['XIX', 'XX', 'XXI', 'XXII', 'XXIII']. Notice that we can also pass variables, which allows us even greater flexibility in dynamically modifying our array's data.

// We have defined a function, mixedNumbers, which we are passing an array as an argument. Modify the function by using push() and unshift() to add 'I', 2, 'three' to the beginning of the array and 7, 'VIII', 9 to the end so that the returned array contains representations of the numbers 1-9 in order.

function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(mixedNumbers(['IV', 5, 'six']));

//answer
function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
arr.unshift('I', 2, 'three');
arr.push(7, 'VIII', 9)
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(mixedNumbers(['IV', 5, 'six']));



//Remove Items from an Array with pop() and shift()
// Both push() and unshift() have corresponding methods that are nearly functional opposites: pop() and shift(). As you may have guessed by now, instead of adding, pop() removes an element from the end of an array, while shift() removes an element from the beginning. The key difference between pop() and shift() and their cousins push() and unshift(), is that neither method takes parameters, and each only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.

// Let's take a look:

let greetings = ['whats up?', 'hello', 'see ya!'];

greetings.pop();
// greetings would have the value ['whats up?', 'hello'].

greetings.shift();
// greetings would have the value ['hello'].

// We can also return the value of the removed element with either method like this:

let popped = greetings.pop();
//It means to have the popped or shifted value returned, you need to store it i a variable.
// greetings would have the value [], and popped would have the value hello.

// We have defined a function, popShift, which takes an array as an argument and returns a new array. Modify the function, using pop() and shift(), to remove the first and last elements of the argument array, and assign the removed elements to their corresponding variables, so that the returned array contains their values.

function popShift(arr) {
  let popped; // Change this line
  let shifted; // Change this line
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));

//answer
function popShift(arr) {
  let popped = arr.pop(); // Change this line
  let shifted = arr.shift(); // Change this line
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));



//Remove Items Using splice()
// Ok, so we've learned how to remove elements from the beginning and end of arrays using shift() and pop(), but what if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well, that's where splice() comes in. splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.

// splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of items in the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:

let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];

array.splice(2, 2);
// Here we remove 2 elements, beginning with the third element (at index 2). array would have the value ['today', 'was', 'great'].

// splice() not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements:

let array = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'];

let newArray = array.splice(3, 2);
// newArray has the value ['really', 'happy'].

// We've initialized an array arr. Use splice() to remove elements from arr, so that it only contains elements that sum to the value of 10.

const arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1];
// Only change code below this line

// Only change code above this line
console.log(arr);

//answer
const arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1];
// Only change code below this line
arr.splice(1, 4)
// Only change code above this line
console.log(arr);



//Add Items Using splice()

// Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 5]
arr.splice(3, 1, 4)

console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

//another example:

const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
console.log(numbers);
// The second occurrence of 12 is removed, and we add 13 and 14 at the same index. The numbers array would now be [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ].

// Here, we begin with an array of numbers. Then, we pass the following to splice(): The index at which to begin deleting elements (3), the number of elements to be deleted (1), and the remaining arguments (13, 14) will be inserted starting at that same index. Note that there can be any number of elements (separated by commas) following amountToDelete, each of which gets inserted.

// We have defined a function, htmlColorNames, which takes an array of HTML colors as an argument. Modify the function using splice() to remove the first two elements of the array and add 'DarkSalmon' and 'BlanchedAlmond' in their respective places.

function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurquoise', 'FireBrick']));

//answer
function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
arr.splice(0, 2, 'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond')
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurquoise', 'FireBrick']));



//Copy Array Items Using slice()
// The next method we will cover is slice(). Rather than modifying an array, slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters — the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:

let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
// todaysWeather would have the value ['snow', 'sleet'], while weatherConditions would still have ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'].

// In effect, we have created a new array by extracting elements from an existing array.

//When the end index is not given, slice will take all of the elements after the start index. You can also omit the start index to copy the entire array. 

//The concat method can be used to glue arrays together to create a new array, similar to what the + operator does for strings. The following example shows both concat and slice in action. It takes an array and an index, and it returns a new array that is a copy of the original array with the element at the given index removed.

function remove(array, index) {
   return array.slice(0, index) 
   .concat(array.slice(index + 1)); 
  } 
  
  console.log(remove(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], 2)); // → ["a", "b", "d", "e"]

// We have defined a function, forecast, that takes an array as an argument. Modify the function using slice() to extract information from the argument array and return a new array that contains the string elements warm and sunny.

function forecast(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  return arr;
}

// Only change code above this line
console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));

//answer
function forecast(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
let newArr = arr.slice(2,4)
  return newArr;
}

// Only change code above this line
console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));



// Copy an Array with the Spread Operator
// While slice() allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, among several other useful tasks, ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...

// In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:

let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
let thatArray = [...thisArray];
// thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]. thisArray remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray.

// We have defined a function, copyMachine which takes arr (an array) and num (a number) as arguments. The function is supposed to return a new array made up of num copies of arr. We have done most of the work for you, but it doesn't work quite right yet. Modify the function using spread syntax so that it works correctly (hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy here!).

function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // Only change code below this line

    // Only change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));

//answer
function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // Only change code below this line
newArr.push([...arr])
    // Only change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));



//Check For The Presence of an Element With indexOf()
// Since arrays can be changed, or mutated, at any time, there's no guarantee about where a particular piece of data will be on a given array, or if that element even still exists. Luckily, JavaScript provides us with another built-in method, indexOf(), that allows us to quickly and easily check for the presence of an element on an array. indexOf() takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that element, or -1 if the element does not exist on the array.

// For example:

let fruits = ['apples', 'pears', 'oranges', 'peaches', 'pears'];

fruits.indexOf('dates');
fruits.indexOf('oranges');
fruits.indexOf('pears');
// indexOf('dates') returns -1, indexOf('oranges') returns 2, and indexOf('pears') returns 1 (the first index at which each element exists).

// indexOf() can be incredibly useful for quickly checking for the presence of an element on an array. We have defined a function, quickCheck, that takes an array and an element as arguments. Modify the function using indexOf() so that it returns true if the passed element exists on the array, and false if it does not.

function quickCheck(arr, elem) {
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(quickCheck(['squash', 'onions', 'shallots'], 'mushrooms'));

//answer

  // Only change code below this line
if (arr.indexOf(elem) >= 0) {
  return true;
} else {
  return false;
}
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(quickCheck(['squash', 'onions', 'shallots'], 'mushrooms'));



// greaterThanTen([2, 12, 8, 14, 80, 0, 1]);
// Using a for loop, this function iterates through and accesses each element of the array, and subjects it to a simple test that we have created. In this way, we have easily and programmatically determined which data items are greater than 10, and returned a new array, [12, 14, 80], containing those items.

// We have defined a function, filteredArray, which takes arr, a nested array, and elem as arguments, and returns a new array. elem represents an element that may or may not be present on one or more of the arrays nested within arr. Modify the function, using a for loop, to return a filtered version of the passed array such that any array nested within arr containing elem has been removed.

function filteredArray(arr, elem) {
  let newArr = [];
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
  return newArr;
}

console.log(filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3));

//answer
function filteredArray(arr, elem) {
  let newArr = [];
  // change code below this line

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i].indexOf(elem) == -1) {
      //Checks every parameter for the element and if is NOT there continues the code
      newArr.push(arr[i]); //Inserts the element of the array in the new filtered array
    }
  }

  // change code above this line
  return newArr;

console.log(filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3));




// Check if an Object has a Property
// Now we can add, modify, and remove keys from objects. But what if we just wanted to know if an object has a specific property? JavaScript provides us with two different ways to do this. One uses the hasOwnProperty() method and the other uses the in keyword. If we have an object users with a property of Alan, we could check for its presence in either of the following ways:

users.hasOwnProperty('Alan');
'Alan' in users;
// Both of these would return true.

// Finish writing the function so that it returns true if the object passed to it contains all four names, Alan, Jeff, Sarah and Ryan and returns false otherwise.
