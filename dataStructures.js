//Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()
// An array's length, like the data types it can contain, is not fixed. Arrays can be defined with a length of any number of elements, and elements can be added or removed over time; in other words, arrays are mutable. In this challenge, we will look at two methods with which we can programmatically modify an array: Array.push() and Array.unshift().

// Both methods take one or more elements as parameters and add those elements to the array the method is being called on; the push() method adds elements to the end of an array, and unshift() adds elements to the beginning. Consider the following:

let twentyThree = 'XXIII';
let romanNumerals = ['XXI', 'XXII'];

romanNumerals.unshift('XIX', 'XX');
romanNumerals would have the value ['XIX', 'XX', 'XXI', 'XXII'].

romanNumerals.push(twentyThree);
// romanNumerals would have the value ['XIX', 'XX', 'XXI', 'XXII', 'XXIII']. Notice that we can also pass variables, which allows us even greater flexibility in dynamically modifying our array's data.

// We have defined a function, mixedNumbers, which we are passing an array as an argument. Modify the function by using push() and unshift() to add 'I', 2, 'three' to the beginning of the array and 7, 'VIII', 9 to the end so that the returned array contains representations of the numbers 1-9 in order.

function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(mixedNumbers(['IV', 5, 'six']));

//answer
function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
arr.unshift('I', 2, 'three');
arr.push(7, 'VIII', 9)
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(mixedNumbers(['IV', 5, 'six']));



//Remove Items from an Array with pop() and shift()
// Both push() and unshift() have corresponding methods that are nearly functional opposites: pop() and shift(). As you may have guessed by now, instead of adding, pop() removes an element from the end of an array, while shift() removes an element from the beginning. The key difference between pop() and shift() and their cousins push() and unshift(), is that neither method takes parameters, and each only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.

// Let's take a look:

let greetings = ['whats up?', 'hello', 'see ya!'];

greetings.pop();
// greetings would have the value ['whats up?', 'hello'].

greetings.shift();
// greetings would have the value ['hello'].

// We can also return the value of the removed element with either method like this:

let popped = greetings.pop();
//It means to have the popped or shifted value returned, you need to store it i a variable.
// greetings would have the value [], and popped would have the value hello.

// We have defined a function, popShift, which takes an array as an argument and returns a new array. Modify the function, using pop() and shift(), to remove the first and last elements of the argument array, and assign the removed elements to their corresponding variables, so that the returned array contains their values.

function popShift(arr) {
  let popped; // Change this line
  let shifted; // Change this line
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));

//answer
function popShift(arr) {
  let popped = arr.pop(); // Change this line
  let shifted = arr.shift(); // Change this line
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));



//Remove Items Using splice()
// Ok, so we've learned how to remove elements from the beginning and end of arrays using shift() and pop(), but what if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well, that's where splice() comes in. splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.

// splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of items in the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:

let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];

array.splice(2, 2);
// Here we remove 2 elements, beginning with the third element (at index 2). array would have the value ['today', 'was', 'great'].

// splice() not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements:

let array = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'];

let newArray = array.splice(3, 2);
// newArray has the value ['really', 'happy'].

// We've initialized an array arr. Use splice() to remove elements from arr, so that it only contains elements that sum to the value of 10.

const arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1];
// Only change code below this line

// Only change code above this line
console.log(arr);

//answer
const arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1];
// Only change code below this line
arr.splice(1, 4)
// Only change code above this line
console.log(arr);



//Add Items Using splice()

// Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 5]
arr.splice(3, 1, 4)

console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

//another example:

const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
console.log(numbers);
// The second occurrence of 12 is removed, and we add 13 and 14 at the same index. The numbers array would now be [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ].

// Here, we begin with an array of numbers. Then, we pass the following to splice(): The index at which to begin deleting elements (3), the number of elements to be deleted (1), and the remaining arguments (13, 14) will be inserted starting at that same index. Note that there can be any number of elements (separated by commas) following amountToDelete, each of which gets inserted.

// We have defined a function, htmlColorNames, which takes an array of HTML colors as an argument. Modify the function using splice() to remove the first two elements of the array and add 'DarkSalmon' and 'BlanchedAlmond' in their respective places.

function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurquoise', 'FireBrick']));

//answer
function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
arr.splice(0, 2, 'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond')
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurquoise', 'FireBrick']));



//Copy Array Items Using slice()
// The next method we will cover is slice(). Rather than modifying an array, slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:

let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
// todaysWeather would have the value ['snow', 'sleet'], while weatherConditions would still have ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'].

// In effect, we have created a new array by extracting elements from an existing array.

// We have defined a function, forecast, that takes an array as an argument. Modify the function using slice() to extract information from the argument array and return a new array that contains the string elements warm and sunny.

function forecast(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  return arr;
}

// Only change code above this line
console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));

//answer
