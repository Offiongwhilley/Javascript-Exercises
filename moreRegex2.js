// Restrict Possible Usernames
// Usernames are used everywhere on the internet. They are what give users a unique identity on their favorite sites.

// You need to check all the usernames in a database. Here are some simple rules that users have to follow when creating their username.

// Usernames can only use alpha-numeric characters.

// The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end. Username cannot start with the number.

// Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.

// Usernames have to be at least two characters long. A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters.

// Change the regex userCheck to fit the constraints listed above.

let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
let userCheck = /^[a-z][a-z]+\d*$|^[a-z]\d\d+$/i; // Change this line
let result = userCheck.test(username);

// Code Explanation
// ^ - start of input
// [a-z] - first character is a letter
// [a-z]+ - following characters are letters
// \d*$ - input ends with 0 or more digits
// | - or
// ^[a-z] - first character is a letter
// \d\d+ - following characters are 2 or more digits
// $ - end of input


// Match Whitespace
// The challenges so far have covered matching letters of the alphabet and numbers. You can also match the whitespace or spaces between letters.

// You can search for whitespace using \s, which is a lowercase s. This pattern not only matches whitespace, but also carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. You can think of it as similar to the character class [ \r\t\f\n\v].

let whiteSpace = "Whitespace. Whitespace everywhere!"
let spaceRegex = /\s/g;
whiteSpace.match(spaceRegex);
// This match call would return [" ", " "].

// Change the regex countWhiteSpace to look for multiple whitespace characters in a string.

let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
let countWhiteSpace = /\s/g; // Change this line
let result = sample.match(countWhiteSpace);


//Match Non-Whitespace Characters
// You learned about searching for whitespace using \s, with a lowercase s. You can also search for everything except whitespace.

// Search for non-whitespace using \S, which is an uppercase s. This pattern will not match whitespace, carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. You can think of it being similar to the character class [^ \r\t\f\n\v].

let whiteSpace = "Whitespace. Whitespace everywhere!"
let nonSpaceRegex = /\S/g;
whiteSpace.match(nonSpaceRegex).length;
// The value returned by the .length method would be 32.

// Change the regex countNonWhiteSpace to look for multiple non-whitespace characters in a string.

let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
let countNonWhiteSpace = /\S/g; // Change this line
let result = sample.match(countNonWhiteSpace);


//Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches
// Recall that you use the plus sign + to look for one or more characters and the asterisk * to look for zero or more characters. These are convenient but sometimes you want to match a certain range of patterns.

// You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets ({ and }). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns.

// For example, to match only the letter a appearing between 3 and 5 times in the string ah, your regex would be /a{3,5}h/.

let A4 = "aaaah";
let A2 = "aah";
let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
multipleA.test(A4);
multipleA.test(A2);
// The first test call would return true, while the second would return false.

// Change the regex ohRegex to match the entire phrase Oh no only when it has 3 to 6 letter h's.
// Remember to use \s after Oh{3,6} to include a white space, followed by no to pass all test cases. All test cases are written using a capital O, however the testcases could also be passed by using ignore-case : /oh{3,6}\sno/i

let ohStr = "Ohhh no";
let ohRegex = /Oh{3,6}\sno/; // Change this line

let result = ohRegex.test(ohStr);


// Specify Only the Lower Number of Matches
// You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers using curly brackets. Sometimes you only want to specify the lower number of patterns with no upper limit.

// To only specify the lower number of patterns, keep the first number followed by a comma.

// For example, to match only the string hah with the letter a appearing at least 3 times, your regex would be /ha{3,}h/.

let A4 = "haaaah";
let A2 = "haah";
let A100 = "h" + "a".repeat(100) + "h";
let multipleA = /ha{3,}h/;
multipleA.test(A4);
multipleA.test(A2);
multipleA.test(A100);
// In order, the three test calls would return true, false, and true.

// Change the regex haRegex to match the word Hazzah only when it has four or more letter z's.

let haStr = "Hazzzzah";
let haRegex = /Haz{4,}ah/; // Change this line
let result = haRegex.test(haStr);


// Specify Exact Number of Matches
// You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers using curly brackets. Sometimes you only want a specific number of matches.

// To specify a certain number of patterns, just have that one number between the curly brackets.

// For example, to match only the word hah with the letter a 3 times, your regex would be /ha{3}h/.

let A4 = "haaaah";
let A3 = "haaah";
let A100 = "h" + "a".repeat(100) + "h";
let multipleHA = /ha{3}h/;
multipleHA.test(A4);
multipleHA.test(A3);
multipleHA.test(A100);
// In order, the three test calls would return false, true, and false.

// Change the regex timRegex to match the word Timber only when it has four letter m's.

let timStr = "Timmmmber";
let timRegex = /Tim{4}b/; // Change this line
let result = timRegex.test(timStr);


// Check for All or None
// Sometimes the patterns you want to search for may have parts of it that may or may not exist. However, it may be important to check for them nonetheless.

// You can specify the possible existence of an element with a question mark, ?. This checks for zero or one of the preceding element. You can think of this symbol as saying the previous element is optional.

// For example, there are slight differences in American and British English and you can use the question mark to match both spellings.

let american = "color";
let british = "colour";
let rainbowRegex= /colou?r/;
rainbowRegex.test(american);
rainbowRegex.test(british);
// Both uses of the test method would return true.

// Change the regex favRegex to match both the American English (favorite) and the British English (favourite) version of the word.

let favWord = "favorite";
let favRegex = /favou?rite/; // Change this line
let result = favRegex.test(favWord);


// Check For Mixed Grouping of Characters
// Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses ().

// If you want to find either Penguin or Pumpkin in a string, you can use the following Regular Expression: /P(engu|umpk)in/g

// Then check whether the desired string groups are in the test string by using the test() method.

let testStr = "Pumpkin";
let testRegex = /P(engu|umpk)in/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// The test method here would return true.

// Fix the regex so that it checks for the names of Franklin Roosevelt or Eleanor Roosevelt in a case sensitive manner and it should make concessions for middle names.

// Then fix the code so that the regex that you have created is checked against myString and either true or false is returned depending on whether the regex matches.

// Use .* to allow for middle names.

let myString = "Eleanor Roosevelt";
let myRegex = /(Eleanor|Franklin).*Roosevelt/; // Change this line
let result = myRegex.test(myString); // Change this line
// After passing the challenge experiment with myString and see how the grouping works
