//Iterate Through the Keys of an Object with a for...in Statement
// Sometimes you may need to iterate through all the keys within an object. This requires a specific syntax in JavaScript called a for...in statement. For our users object, this could look like:

for (let user in users) {
  console.log(user);
}
// This would log Alan, Jeff, and Sarah - each value on its own line.

// In this statement, we defined a variable user, and as you can see, this variable was reset during each iteration to each of the object's keys as the statement looped through the object, resulting in each user's name being printed to the console.

// NOTE: Objects do not maintain an ordering to stored keys like arrays do; thus a key's position on an object, or the relative order in which it appears, is irrelevant when referencing or accessing that key.

//We've defined a function countOnline which accepts one argument (a users object). Use a for...in statement within this function to loop through the users object passed into the function and return the number of users whose online property is set to true. An example of a users object which could be passed to countOnline is shown below. Each user will have an online property with either a true or false value.

const users = {
  Alan: {
    online: false
  },
  Jeff: {
    online: true
  },
  Sarah: {
    online: false
  }
}

function countOnline(usersObj) {
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(countOnline(users));

//Problem Explanation
// Note: dot-notation will cause errors in this challenge.
// [square-bracket] notation must be used to call a variable property name.

const users = {
  Alan: {
    online: false

  Jeff: {
    online: true
  },
  Sarah: {
    online: false
  }
}

function countOnline(usersObj) {
  // Only change code below this line

for (let user in usersObj) {
  if(usersObj[user].online === true){
    userCount ++;

return userCount;
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(countOnline(users));



//Generate an Array of All Object Keys with Object.keys()
// We can also generate an array which contains all the keys stored in an object with the Object.keys() method. This method takes an object as the argument and returns an array of strings representing each property in the object. Again, there will be no specific order to the entries in the array.

// Finish writing the getArrayOfUsers function so that it returns an array containing all the properties in the object it receives as an argument.

  Alan: {
    age: 27,

//Modify an Array Stored in an Object
// Now you've seen all the basic operations for JavaScript objects. You can add, modify, and remove key-value pairs, check if keys exist, and iterate over all the keys in an object. As you continue learning JavaScript you will see even more versatile applications of objects. Additionally, the Data Structures lessons located in the Coding Interview Prep section of the curriculum also cover the ES6 Map and Set objects, both of which are similar to ordinary objects but provide some additional features. Now that you've learned the basics of arrays and objects, you're fully prepared to begin tackling more complex problems using JavaScript!

// Take a look at the object we've provided in the code editor. The user object contains three keys. The data key contains five keys, one of which contains an array of friends. From this, you can see how flexible objects are as data structures. We've started writing a function addFriend. Finish writing it so that it takes a user object and adds the name of the friend argument to the array stored in user.data.friends and returns that array.

let user = {
  name: 'Kenneth',
  age: 28,
  data: {
    username: 'kennethCodesAllDay',
    joinDate: 'March 26, 2016',
    organization: 'freeCodeCamp',
    friends: [
      'Sam',

    location: {

      state: 'CA',
      country: 'USA'
    }
